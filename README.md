#GAN-ETAN is the new name, FiETAN is the old name. They are same.


Extended Tree Augmented Naive Classifier (ETAN) is 
a recently proposed model which relax the independence assumption between input features. 
However, it is usually challenging to train a good ETAN, because it needs more training data. 
To address this problem, in this paper, we introduce the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), 
which has the ability to model the probability distribution of original data and generate synthetic data that close to the realistic data. 
Moreover, the generated data can also enhance the original correlation and independence among features and class. 
We name our method as GAN-ETAN, and experiments on 6 real world datasets show the GAN-ETAN can improve the classification performance of original ETAN in some extent.
