This work combines Extended Tree Augmented Naive Classifier (ETAN) and Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN). GAN has the ability to model the probability distribution of original data and generate realistic synthetic data,
which can enhance the strong correlation and improve the
independence of features and class. Structure learning is then
performed from the enhanced data using ETANâ€™s method.
A range of experiments show that our method improves the
Bayesian classification ability of ETAN.
